# wordle-lite

## Developer Environment

* For the backend service, run "cd backend && yarn install && yarn dev".  

* For the database, the backend service expects a local instance of MongoDB running on port 27017.

* For the frontend service, run "cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev".

## User Experience

* Users should be able to input their wordle guess and receive feedback after hitting "Submit" on the browser.


## FYI

* I'm using this repo as an exercise to learn the MERN stack.
